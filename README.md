# DSA-NES
The NES assignment of DSA4212 semester 2 AY2023/2024

This study indicates that Particle Swarm Optimization might be preferable over the fast version of Natural Evolution Strategies implemented for low dimensional problems. There is significant uncertainty due to hyperparameters and randomnes. Interestingly, the approximations made to the full NES algorithm seem to still yield significantly better performance than ES, despite carrying a very small cost in terms of time and memory.
